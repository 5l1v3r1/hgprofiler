Purpose
===

HG Profiler is a tool that allows users to take a list of entities from a particular source and look for those same entities across a pre-defined list of other sources. The tool is based on the Recon-ng tool's profiler module (see http://webbreacher.blogspot.com/2014/12/recon-ng-profiler-module.html).
