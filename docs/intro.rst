.. note:: Profiler is new prototype software that is in the *very* early
    stages of development. The software and the documentation are subject to
    change without notice.

Profiler is a tool for investigating web personas across many different web
sites rapidly. Profiler helps locate identifying information about these
personas, such as real names, locations, photographs, ages, hobbies, travel
patterns, etc. â€” anything that can be used to tie that anonymous personal to a
real-world identity.
